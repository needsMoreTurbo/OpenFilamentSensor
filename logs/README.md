# Log Storage

Drop any ESP32 logs, simulator captures, or other diagnostic files you want us to review into this folder. The contents of logs/ are ignored by Git, so feel free to upload large crash dumps without polluting the repository.

After we review a file, move that log into logs/history/ along with a short text summary (see logs/history/README.md) and delete the original to keep the landing folder clean.
